= M3u-Builder

M3u-Builder is a simple Haskell script which generates m3u-playlist files based
on a playlist file which you are providing the program as input. 

== How it works

It queries for each element of your input-playlist the last.fm API in order to
find similar tracks. Those tracks are collected and filtered with the music on
your filesystem, so that only music in the playlist shows up, which is actually
on your filesystem.

== Limitations

Only MP3 files and M3U-playlists are supported. The ID3(v2) parser might still
be incomplete and might sometimes not work as expected.
Querying a lot of music in the playlist might take a while, since HTTP-requests
aren't done in parallel.

== Usage

m3u-builder <music-directory> <playlist> [number-of-tracks]

The music directory is a directory on your file system in which all your music
is stored. It will be scanned for new mp3-files each time the program is run.
To improve performance the parsing results are cached in the
~/.m3u-builder/cache file to improve the performance. If you modify the 
ID3-tags of one of your mp3-files you should manually clear the cache by
simply deleting the file.

The playlist is a m3u-playlist.

The number of tracks is an optional number, which indicates the top N tracks of
the given playlist which should be used for querying last.fm. If no number is
given all tracks are queried from last.fm.
